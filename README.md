# Coding Challenge
Charactor enconding for input to the related english alphabet 
# Requriement 
- Here is an old phone keypad with alphabetical letters, a backspace key, and a send button.
Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button multiple times will cycle through the letters on it allowing each button to represent more than one letter.
- For example, pressing 2 once will return ‘A’ but pressing twice
in succession will return ‘B’.
- You must pause for a second in order to type two characters from the same
button after each other: “222 2 22” -> “CAB”.
# Prompt:
- Please design and document a class of method that will turn any input to OldPhonePad
into the correct output.
- Assume that a send “#” will always be included at the end of every input.

# Code Implementation  
`
public static String OldPhonePad(string input) {
//Please write your implementaion here.
}
`
# Examples outpus:
- OldPhonePad(“33#”) => output: E
- OldPhonePad(“227*#”) => output: B
- OldPhonePad(“4433555 555666#”) => output: HELLO
- OldPhonePad(“8 88777444666*664#”) => output: ????? =>TURINNG
- OldPhonePad(“888 85632*361*#”) => output: ????? =>VTJMDDM
